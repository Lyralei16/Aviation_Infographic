# Aviation_Infographic

!!! Assignemnt description !!!
To gain insight into flight patterns from Dutch airports, you will build a visualisation presenting the available data on the matter in a manageable fashion. There is a lot of Open Data available through the Central Bureau for Statistics (CBS), but raw statistics make it difficult to understand current trends in flight patterns. In the past, there were static infographics drawn on a yearly basis, but because of the limited interaction possibilities we need keeping these infographics up-to-date automatically.

Your (fictitious) client has no preference for the way the data is presented, and how you choose the tell the story behind the data. More importantly, the infographic should give an immediate and clear view of current flight pattern trends, preferably in comparison with (the) previous year(s). The infographic should at least contain a short textual summary with some average figures. These figures could illustrate a comparison with last yearâ€™s rates, and maybe some interesting facts that the viewer should pay attention to. In addition, it is important to be able to view more substantial information via tables and/or graphs, and that the receiver should be tempted to read the information through aesthetically appealing presentations and some (simple) animation techniques.

<<--Assesmnent Rubrics-->>

// TO SCORE EXCELLENT: 

The data visualisation is of excellent quality AND several custom-made original visualisation methods have been used to display the data.

The implemented interactive components are  meaningful AND lead to the presentation of new relevant information for at least 2 visualisation methods AND different types of user interaction are implemented (click events, scroll events, swipe events etc). 
Where relevant an animation has been added to each interactive/dynamic component AND SVG or CSS animations have been used

The JSON data is requested via an API AND it is used in more than 2 visualization methods (charts, tables or dynamic texts), AND different statistics have been generated (totals, means, sums, different categories, etc).
The data is presented dynamically AND the application communicates  errors sufficiently AND the application can show information for different categories seperately (fireworks violations and violent crimes for example). 

All parts are commented according to JSDoc guidelines, all requested theory is mentioned AND student demonstrated a thorough understanding of mentioned theory
