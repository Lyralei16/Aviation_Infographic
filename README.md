# Aviation_Infographic
The infographic consists of a single webpage with different (interactive) visualisation methods. The difference between a static and dynamic infographics is the real- time presentation of data. This means that your infographic will always be up to date and that your visualisations conform to the data. In addition, you will use interactivity to hide and show data when the user requires it. This ensures that a user is not overwhelmed with an abundance of information and you maintain a clean layout. Finally, you will be asked to apply animation techniques to emphasise change within the data.
